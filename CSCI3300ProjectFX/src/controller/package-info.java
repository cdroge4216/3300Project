  *Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces 
 *on computers. It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, 
 *so as to separate internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented to or accepted from the user.
 *A model is an object representing data or even activity, e.g. a database table or even some plant-floor production-machine process.
A view is some form of visualization of the state of the model.
A controller offers facilities to change the state of the model.

Any public field with a variable name matching the fx:id attribute, or
Any field (public or not) with a variable name matching the fx:id attribute that is annotated with @FXML.
